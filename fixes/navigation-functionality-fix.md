# Navigation and Functionality Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **Missing Function: `generateAllInvoices`**
   - Error: `ReferenceError: generateAllInvoices is not defined`
   - Fix: Implemented the missing `generateAllInvoices` function in `invoices.js`
   - The function now properly generates invoices for all children in the current month
   - Added UI feedback with spinner during generation and success message on completion

2. **Missing Function: `exportToCSV`**
   - Error: `ReferenceError: exportToCSV is not defined`
   - Fix: Implemented the missing `exportToCSV` function in `invoices.js`
   - The function now properly exports invoice data to a CSV file for all children in the current month
   - Added UI feedback with spinner during export and automatic download of the CSV file

3. **Incorrect Function Reference: `showAttendanceSection`**
   - Error: `ReferenceError: showAttendanceSection is not defined`
   - Fix: Replaced the call to non-existent `showAttendanceSection` with the correct `selectChild` function
   - Updated the `saveChild` function in `children.js` to use the proper function for showing the attendance section

## Technical Details

The main issues were related to missing or incorrectly referenced functions that were causing JavaScript errors and preventing navigation between different sections of the application.

1. The `generateAllInvoices` function was referenced in the event listener setup but was never defined. We implemented this function to:
   - Get all children for the current month
   - Show a loading spinner during generation
   - Update the invoices UI
   - Display a success message when complete

2. The `exportToCSV` function was referenced in the event listener setup but was never defined. We implemented this function to:
   - Get all children for the current month
   - Create CSV content with headers and data rows for each child
   - Generate a downloadable CSV file with invoice data
   - Show a loading spinner during export
   - Automatically trigger the download

3. The `showAttendanceSection` function was called in the `saveChild` function but didn't exist. We found that the correct function to use was `selectChild` from `attendance_simplified.js`, which properly:
   - Sets the current child ID
   - Updates the attendance title with the child's name
   - Generates the simplified calendar view
   - Shows the attendance section and hides the children section

## Testing

The application has been tested to ensure:
- Navigation between sections works correctly
- The "Generate All Invoices" button functions properly
- Adding a new child correctly navigates to the attendance section
- The invoice preview modal displays correctly with the calendar UI improvements
