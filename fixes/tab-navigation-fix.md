# Tab Navigation Fix

## Issue
The Invoice and Settings tabs were not working when clicked. Users couldn't navigate to these sections of the application.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by problematic event handler setup in the `setupNavigation` function in `app.js`. The previous implementation used a generic approach to attach click handlers to all navigation links, but there were issues with event propagation and handler registration.

## Solution
The solution was to replace the generic event handler approach with direct event handlers for each navigation tab:

1. Removed the dynamic event handler setup that was looping through all nav links
2. Added direct event handlers for each specific navigation tab (Children, Invoices, Settings)
3. Created a helper function `showSection()` to handle the common logic of:
   - Hiding all sections
   - Showing the selected section
   - Updating the active state of navigation links
4. Fixed indentation and syntax errors in the surrounding code

## Benefits
- More reliable navigation between application sections
- Clearer code that explicitly shows which tabs are supported
- Easier to debug since each tab has its own dedicated click handler
- Better separation of concerns with the helper function

## Testing
The fix was tested by:
- Clicking on each navigation tab to ensure proper section display
- Verifying that the active tab styling updates correctly
- Confirming that all sections (Children, Invoices, Settings) are accessible
