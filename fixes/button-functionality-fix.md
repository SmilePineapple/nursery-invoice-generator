# Button Functionality Fix

## Issue
The Set Attendance and View Invoice buttons were not working properly. When clicked:
- Set Attendance button showed an empty page without the attendance calendar
- View Invoice button did nothing

## Root Cause Analysis
1. The event handlers were being attached correctly, but the functions they were calling had issues:
   - For Set Attendance: The `generateCalendarView` function wasn't being called properly
   - For View Invoice: The modal was defined correctly in HTML but the function wasn't working

2. There were multiple event handlers being attached to the same buttons, causing conflicts

## Solution
1. Implemented a single, consistent event delegation approach in app.js
2. Added proper error handling and debugging to identify the exact issues
3. Fixed the function calls to ensure they work correctly
4. Made sure all necessary HTML elements exist and are properly referenced
5. Ensured proper navigation between sections

## Implementation Details
- Used event delegation in app.js to handle all button clicks
- Added direct calls to generate the calendar view and update the attendance legend
- Fixed the modal display for invoice previews
- Added error handling to catch and report any issues

## Lessons Learned
- Always use consistent event handling approaches (either direct or delegated)
- Add proper error handling to identify issues quickly
- Check that all necessary HTML elements exist before trying to use them
- Use console logging to debug complex issues
