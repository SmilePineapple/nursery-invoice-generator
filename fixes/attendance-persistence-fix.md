# Attendance Persistence Fix

## Issue
When setting and saving attendance for a child, reopening the Set Attendance modal showed no data. The attendance data was not being properly saved or loaded.

## Root Cause
The attendance data was being saved to a local child object in the attendance_simplified.js file, but this data was not being properly synchronized with the main appData structure. When toggling attendance or saving attendance, the changes were made to a local copy of the child object, but these changes were not being properly reflected in the main appData structure.

## Solution
1. Modified the `toggleAllDayAttendance` function to ensure the child reference in appData is updated with the attendance data:
   ```javascript
   // CRITICAL FIX: Ensure the child reference in appData is updated with the attendance data
   // Find the child in the appData structure and update it directly
   const childIndex = appData.months[appData.currentMonth].children.findIndex(c => c.id === child.id);
   if (childIndex !== -1) {
       // Make sure calendarAttendance exists
       if (!appData.months[appData.currentMonth].children[childIndex].calendarAttendance) {
           appData.months[appData.currentMonth].children[childIndex].calendarAttendance = {};
       }
       
       // Copy the attendance data from the local child object to the appData structure
       if (child.calendarAttendance) {
           appData.months[appData.currentMonth].children[childIndex].calendarAttendance = 
               JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(child.calendarAttendance));
       }
   }
   ```

2. Applied the same fix to the `saveAttendance` function to ensure attendance data is properly synchronized with the main appData structure.

3. Fixed a reference issue with the `updateInvoicesUI` function by adding a check to see if the function exists before calling it:
   ```javascript
   // Update invoices to reflect attendance data if function exists
   if (typeof updateInvoicesUI === 'function') {
       updateInvoicesUI();
   }
   ```

4. Updated the index.html file to use attendance_simplified.js instead of attendance.js since that's the file we've been working with.

5. Fixed a syntax error in invoices.js by removing an unmatched catch block that was causing JavaScript execution to fail.

## Additional Fixes
- Removed debugging console.log statements that were added during the debugging process
- Ensured proper error handling for missing functions

## Testing
The fix was tested by:
1. Setting attendance for a child
2. Saving the attendance data
3. Reopening the Set Attendance modal to verify the attendance data persisted
4. Checking that the attendance data is properly reflected in the invoice view

## Lessons Learned
When working with complex data structures that are passed by reference, it's important to ensure that changes made to local copies are properly synchronized with the main data structure. In this case, using a deep copy (via JSON.parse/stringify) ensured that the attendance data was properly saved and loaded.
