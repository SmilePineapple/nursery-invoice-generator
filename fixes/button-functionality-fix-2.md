# Button Functionality Fix

## Issue
All buttons stopped working and the month dropdown wasn't displaying any months. The application was completely non-functional due to JavaScript syntax errors.

## Root Cause
Two critical issues were identified:

1. **Syntax Error in invoices.js**: 
   - There was an unexpected token `}` around line 872 in the `invoices.js` file
   - This was causing the JavaScript to fail to parse, preventing all functionality

2. **Navigation Event Handler Issues**:
   - The changes to the navigation system in `app.js` affected the initialization order
   - Event handlers for buttons and dropdowns weren't being properly attached

## Solution
The solution involved two key fixes:

1. **Fixed Syntax Error in invoices.js**:
   - Properly closed the `generateInvoiceCalendarView` function
   - Removed extra closing braces that were causing syntax errors

2. **Improved Application Initialization in app.js**:
   - Enhanced the DOMContentLoaded event handler to ensure proper initialization order
   - Added explicit UI update calls to ensure all components are properly rendered
   - Refactored the setupNavigation function to use a more reliable event handler approach

## Benefits
- All buttons now work correctly
- Month dropdown displays months properly
- Navigation between tabs functions as expected
- Invoice generation and attendance tracking work properly

## Testing
The fix was tested by:
- Checking that all buttons respond to clicks
- Verifying that the month dropdown displays correctly
- Testing navigation between all tabs
- Testing invoice generation and attendance tracking
